# Filtering the Stars

This is a triple threat of useEffect and filter! Your mission should you accept it:

There are three different areas of this lab, moons, stars, and planets. For each of them, fetch data from the appropriate source, render that data, and build out the appropriate functions to filter that data using the proper components.

How you build the filter is up to you but it should still follow the guidelines laid out by the components (look at the components for more info).

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this repo, `cd phase-2-filter-practice` and then run `npm install`.

Start the servers with `npm start` and in a separate terminal run `npm run server`.

You can access the URLs for the different resources at:

```
Moons: http://localhost:4000/moons
Stars: http://localhost:4000/stars
Planets: http://localhost:4000/planets
```

You'll need to make a request for the proper resource in each of `MoonsContainer`, `StarsContainer`, and `PlanetsContainer`.

Good luck and have fun!
